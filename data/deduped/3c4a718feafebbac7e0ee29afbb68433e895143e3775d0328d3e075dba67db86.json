The Python Core Mentorship Program is predicated on\nthe idea that Python core, and Python as a whole would be served by\nfurther lowering the barrier to entry of contribution to Python core\n(original proposal) The mission of the Python Core Mentor Program is to provide an open\nand welcoming place to connect students, programmers \u2013 and\nanyone interested in contributing to the Python core\ndevelopment. This project is based on the idea that the best way to\nwelcome new people into any project is a venue which connects them to\na variety of mentors who can assist in guiding them through the\ncontribution process, including discussions on lists such as python-dev,\nand python-ideas, the bug tracker, Git questions, code reviews, etc. Additionally, mentors assist in something incredibly critical to\nmaintain contributor interest: getting patches through the process and actually\ncommitted. We all know \u2013 not everyone who is mentor will have all the\nanswers, so mentors also act as conduits to others who will have the\nanswer. The most important point to make is that everyone is welcome and no\none, no matter who they are, is turned away. Keep to the code of conduct, and\nhelp those around you. The following code of conduct is not meant as a means for punishment, action\nor censorship for the mailing list or project. Instead, it is meant to set the\ntone and expectations and comfort level for mentors and those wishing to be\nmentored on the list. The Python Software Foundation is the organization behind Python. Become a member of the PSF and help advance the software and our mission.  \nCopyright \u00a92001-2025.\n                            \u00a0Python Software Foundation\n
