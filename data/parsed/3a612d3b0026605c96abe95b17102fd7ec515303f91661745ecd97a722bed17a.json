Python allows mandatory and optional arguments, keyword arguments, and even arbitrary argument lists. More about defining functions in Python\u00a03 Lists (known as arrays in other languages) are one of the compound data types that Python understands. Lists can be indexed, sliced and manipulated with other built-in functions. More about lists in Python\u00a03 Calculations are simple with Python, and expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work as expected; parentheses () can be used for grouping. More about simple math functions in Python\u00a03. Python knows the usual control flow statements that other languages speak \u2014 if, for, while and range \u2014 with some of its own twists, of course. More control flow tools in Python\u00a03 Experienced programmers in any other language can pick up Python very quickly, and beginners find the clean syntax and indentation structure easy to learn. Whet your appetite with our Python\u00a03 overview. Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.
