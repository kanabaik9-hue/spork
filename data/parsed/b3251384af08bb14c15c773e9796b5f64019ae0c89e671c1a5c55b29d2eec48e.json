The events are also listed on a map mashup created by Luis Miguel Morillas:  http://lmorillas.github.io/python_events/  Here's a snapshot showing all events from Jan 2012 - March 2016:        Contents    \n If you would like to get new events listed on these calendars, please write to events@python.org using the following email template:   Please mention:  the location (venue address, including city and country)  a link with more details for the event (using HTML format \"<a\u00a0href=\"http://url/\">name\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0event</a>\"); URL shorteners are not permitted.  For recurring events, please also include the recurrence information, e.g. \"monthly, every second Thursday\".  Notes:  For training sessions, courses, webinars and similar type of events, please post your event on the PythonTraining page. We currently do not have a calendar for these.   Please leave at least 4 weeks notice when submitting events. The calendar team is volunteer driven. While we try to add new events swiftly, we cannot guarantee response times.  \n In some cases, the email format may not be suitable, e.g. if you want to submit several larger events in one go. For those cases, please list the events in the email sent to events@python.org, including the following details:  for each event, or as summary, so that we can tell which type of event you want entered and whether they are suitable for our calendars.  Please attach the event data as iCal file events.ics using the following entry format:  title: name\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0event  start and end dates: start day and end day of the event, entered as \"all day events\" for larger events, or as start and end date and time in the local timezone for smaller single day events  location: city,\u00a0[state,]\u00a0country  description: <a\u00a0href=\"http://url/\">name\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0event</a>  The same notes as above apply to bulk submissions.  \n Python Events Calendar - mostly meant for conferences and larger local events Calendar ID: j7gov1cmnqr9tvg14k621j7t5c@group.calendar.google.com  Python User Group Calendar - meant for user group events and other smaller local events Calendar ID: 3haig2m9msslkpf2tn1h56nn9g@group.calendar.google.com  Both calendars combined - in a single calendar widget  \n Python Events Calendar  Python User Group Calendar  \n Note: Google has switched off calendar RSS feeds on Nov 18 2015, so these links no longer work.  Python Events Calendar  Python User Group Calendar  \n @PythonEvents  This Twitter account automatically gets all new entries from both calendars as tweets. The triggering is setup using IFTTT. Note that changes to the calendar entries are not reported on the Twitter feed. This appears to be a limitation of the IFTTT trigger.  \n If you'd like to embed the calendar into your site, please ping us at events@python.org before doing so. We'd like to keep a list of sites where the calendars are displayed.  You can find the embedding code further below on this page.  \n https://www.python.org/ (in the events box on the front page and on the events calendar pages)  http://www.pycon.org/ (calendar widget under the conference listing)  http://legacy.python.org/ (in the side bar on the left of all pages)  https://pythonz.net/events (a Russian site)  \n The following people are team members with admin rights to the calendars:  These are our team members with editing rights:  If you want to join the team, please sign up to the python-events ML and send a short intro about yourself together with a Google compatible email address to the list. Thanks.  The following people are inactive team members:  \n The team uses the python-events mailing list for discussion and to process events. The events@python.org address is an alias for the python-events mailing list.  https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-events   As team member, it is vital for you to subscribe to this list, otherwise you won't get the incoming event notifications.  \n In order to make the decision of whether to add an event and where to add it easier, we've setup a few guidelines:  \n Examples are Python conferences, conferences which have a Python track or tutorial, conferences at which Python is presented in some form. The same goes for conferences which target a project written mostly in Python (e.g. Plone, Django, OpenStack, etc.) and for other events such as sprints.  For online events, such as PyWeek game jams, only a reasonably short events (no longer than two weeks) should be added as single event. For longer events, it's better to just add the start and end date as separate events to the calendar, or even just the start date and then mention the end in the description. The same criteria for calendars apply to online events as well. Please add these using Online or Online\u00a0Event as location. For hybrid events (both in-person and virtual), mentioning and\u00a0Online after the in-person location is possible as well.  \n Python Events Calendar: This calendar should only receive entries for conferences of at least around 100 attendees, which at least around a 3rd non-local attendees. Smaller events with at least around 30 attendees such as sprints, barcamps, PyDays or smaller unconferences may also be added to this calendar if they are scheduled as separate event, will have a significant impact and reach out to larger regions. Examples: PyCon conferences, OSCON, Django conferences, Plone conference, Need-for-speed sprints, Python BarCamps/Unconferences/etc.  \n Some notes regarding entries for the admins:  Please add a link to the event as description. We have standardized on using HTML links for this, e.g. <a\u00a0href=\"http://www.pycon.fr/2012/>PyCon\u00a0FR\u00a02012</a>. Note that the Google calendar UI was changed some time ago to no longer accept HTML as input. Instead, you have to paste the HTML link directly into the description box. Calendar interfaces using iCal typically require adding the full HTML.  All calendar admins can invite more people as calendar admins. When doing so, please add the new admins to the above list and ping the team by writing to events@python.org and also to get their email address added to the python-events mailing list.  \n This iframe code is used on pycon.org to display the calendar:  \n Google Calendar API v2 Atom Reference.
